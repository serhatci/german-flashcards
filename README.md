Learning German is not easy... Regular repetition of new words and other grammar topics is the key to any German learning process. germanflashcards.net provides a free platform to people where they can boost their german learning by using flashcards created on several topics. Core data is continuously updated by me and may not be totally helpful for absolute beginners but people above at least B1 german knowledge. Registered users can have full control of the data and create their own learning topics and flashcards freely.
